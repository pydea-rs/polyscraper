    "question": "Will US inflation be more than 0.4% from December 2022 to January 2023?",
    "description": "This is a market on a month-to-month inflation, as measured by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (CPI-U), from December 2022 to January 2023.\n\nInflation is measured by a change in Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) on a seasonally adjusted basis, reported by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nThis market will resolve to \u201cYes\u201d if the index increased by more than 0.4 percent (on a seasonally adjusted basis) from December 2022 to January 2023 and \u201cNo\u201c otherwise.\n\nThe resolution source for this market will be the BLS January 2023 Consumer Price Index report (https://www.bls.gov/bls/news-release/cpi.htm), currently scheduled to be released on February 14, 2023, at 8:30 AM ET. Resolution of this market will take place upon release of the aforementioned data.\n\n----\n\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure of the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services.\n\nNote: the resolution source for this market will be the official monthly BLS CPI news release which reports seasonally-adjusted month-to-month inflation to only one decimal point (e.g. 0.7%, 0.6%, etc). Thus, this is the level of precision that will be used when resolving the market (e.g. if seasonally adjusted month-to-month CPI-U is 0.5%, the market will resolve to \u201cYes\u201d, if it is 0.4%, this market will resolve to \u201cNo\u201d).",

If there is still no data point, this market will resolve according to the nearest previous available approval rating to December 29. \n\nIf Joe Biden is not President on the resolution date, this market will resolve according to the nearest previous available approval rating to December 29. \n\nPlease note the resolution source reports the rating value to only one decimal point (e.g. 42.8%, 33.9%, etc). Thus, this is the level of precision that will be used when resolving the market.",

    "description": "This market asks whether Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) will set foot in the United States between December 13, 2022, and February 15, 2023, 11:59:59 PM ET. \n\nIf SBF sets foot in the United States between December 13, 2022 and February 15, 2023, 11:59:59 PM ET, this market will resolve to \"Yes\". Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\". \n\nFor the purpose of this market, \"setting foot in the United States\" is defined as SBF physically entering the terrestrial or maritime territory of the United States. Setting foot on US territories such as Guam and Puerto Rico will count for this market. If SBF sets foot in a United States embassy, it will not suffice to resolve this market to \"Yes.\"  Whether or not SBF enters United States airspace during the timeframe of this market will have no bearing on a positive resolution. \n\nThe primary resolution source for this information will be official information from government of the United States of America, however a consensus of credible reporting will also be used.",

    "description": "'Avatar: The Way of Water' (2022) is an upcoming American action adventure fantasy sci-fi film produced by 20th Century Studios. It is the second installment of the Avatar film series directed by James Cameron. It is scheduled for theatrical release in the USA on December 16, 2022.\n\nThis is a market on how much \u2018Avatar: The Way of Water' will gross domestically on its opening weekend. The \u201cDomestic Weekend\u201d tab on https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt1630029/ will be used to resolve this market once the values for the opening weekend (Dec 16-18) are final (i.e. not studio estimates).\n\nThis market will resolve to \"Yes\" if \u2018Avatar: The Way of Water\u2019 grosses more than $175,000,000 on its opening weekend. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nOpening weekend is defined as the first Friday, Saturday, and Sunday of the film's release. Please note, this market will resolve according to the Box Office Mojo number under Domestic Weekend for the 3-day weekend, regardless of whether domestic refers to only the USA, or to USA and Canada, etc.\n\nIf there is no final data available by December 26, 2022, 11:59:59 PM ET, another credible resolution source will be chosen.\n",

    "description": "A prediction market on whether Russia will use nuclear weapons has been requested many times recently by esteemed academics and thought leaders from across the world, and it is strongly within the public's interest to have accurate price discovery and realtime forecasts on such a topic. Existing prediction markets on this subject lack functional price discovery mechanisms, and thus are misleading the people; therefore it was deemed necessary to support this market as a public good, in order to provide clarity to society on one of the most pressing issues.\n\nThis market will resolve to \"Yes\" if the Russian Federation detonates a nuclear device in an offensive capacity by June 30, 2023, 11:59:59 PM ET. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nTo satisfy a \"Yes\" resolution, the detonation of a nuclear device must be in an offensive capacity (whether deliberate or accidental), must not be a test, and must be either claimed by the Russian Federation or considered by a preponderance of credible reporting and/or information from credible sources to be from the Russian Federation.\n\nFor the purpose of this market's resolution, determination as to whether a detonation was nuclear will be made by a preponderance of credible reporting.",

Resolution of this market will take place upon release of the aforementioned data. \n\n---\n\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure of the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services.\n\nNote that the resolution source for this market will be the official monthly BLS CPI news release which reports seasonally-adjusted month-to-month inflation to only one decimal point (e.g. 0.7%, 0.6%, etc).

Resolution of this market will take place upon release of the aforementioned data.\n\n----\n\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure of the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services.\n\nNote: the resolution source for this market will be the official monthly BLS CPI news release which reports seasonally-adjusted month-to-month inflation to only one decimal point (e.g. 0.7%, 0.6%, etc). Thus, this is the level of precision that will be used when resolving the market (e.g. if seasonally adjusted month-to-month CPI-U is 0.6%, the market will resolve to \u201cYes\u201d, if it is 0.5%, this market will resolve to \u201cNo\u201d).",

Resolution of this market will take place upon release of the aforementioned data.\n\n----\n\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure of the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services.\n\nNote: the resolution source for this market will be the official monthly BLS CPI news release which reports seasonally-adjusted month-to-month inflation to only one decimal point (e.g. 0.7%, 0.6%, etc).

Binance.us is not considered for this market.\n\nBinance.com withdrawals being suspended for a majority of users means that a majority of users are unable to withdraw their BTC and/or ETH from Binance (E.g.

Empirically speaking, having a live token will be considered fulfilled if official project channels announce the introduction of the token and it is live on mainnet, and swappable and acquirable (i.e. via Uniswap). In the case of a token being announced but not yet transferrable or \u201clive\u201d, that will not satisfy market conditions. If the token is deployed to mainnet (in any form, including some sort of voucher), but is not transferrable, that will also not satisfy market conditions. In the case of ERC20 tokens, if the token is deployed, but there is no existing Uniswap pool for the token, it will be considered not \u201clive\u201d and thus will not satisfy market conditions.

    "description": "This is a market on a month-to-month inflation, as measured by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (CPI-U), from November to December 2022. \n\nInflation is measured by a change in Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) on a seasonally adjusted basis, reported by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. \n\nThis market will resolve to \u201cYes\u201d if the index increased by more than 0.0 percent (on a seasonally adjusted basis) from November to December 2022 and \u201cNo\u201c otherwise. \n\nThe resolution source for this market will be the BLS December 2022 Consumer Price Index report (https://www.bls.gov/bls/news-release/cpi.htm), currently scheduled to be released on January 12, 2023, at 8:30 AM ET. Resolution of this market will take place upon release of the aforementioned data. \n\n----\n\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure of the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services. \n\nNote: the resolution source for this market will be the official monthly BLS CPI news release which reports seasonally-adjusted month-to-month inflation to only one decimal point (e.g. 0.7%, 0.6%, etc). Thus, this is the level of precision that will be used when resolving the market (e.g. if seasonally adjusted month-to-month CPI-U is 0.0%, the market will resolve to \u201cNo\u201d, if it is 0.1%, this market will resolve to \u201cYes\u201d).\n",

    "description": "'Cocaine Bear' (2023) is an upcoming American thriller film produced by Universal Pictures. It follows the exploits of a series of unlikely characters who end up in a forest with a bear who unintentionally ingested a large amount of cocaine. It is scheduled for theatrical release in the USA on February 24, 2023.\n\nThis is a market on how much \u2018Cocaine Bear' will gross domestically on its opening weekend. The \u201cDomestic Weekend\u201d tab on https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt14209916/ will be used to resolve this market once the values for the opening weekend (Feb 24-26) are final (i.e. not studio estimates).\n\nThis market will resolve to \"Yes\" if \u2018Cocaine Bear\u2019 grosses more than $12,000,000 on its opening weekend. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\".\n\nOpening weekend is defined as the first Friday, Saturday, and Sunday of the film's release. Please note, this market will resolve according to the Box Office Mojo number under Domestic Weekend for the 3-day weekend, regardless of whether domestic refers to only the USA, or to USA and Canada, etc.\n\nIf there is no final data available by March 13, 2023, 11:59:59 PM ET, another credible resolution source will be chosen.\n",

Otherwise, this market will resolve to \"No\". \n\nFor the purpose of this market's resolution, any detonation of a nuclear weapon anywhere on the planet Earth will be sufficient to trigger a \"Yes\" resolution. This includes offensive usages, nuclear tests, and accidental detonations. Use/launch of a nuclear weapon that fails to detonate, a fake weapon that never detonates, or a dirty bomb that distributes radioactive material by means of a conventional explosion are not sufficient to trigger a \"Yes\" resolution of this market. Only a successful nuclear detonation will result in a \"Yes\" resolution. \n\nThis market may resolve to \"Yes\" as soon as a nuclear detonation is confirmed by a preponderance of credible reporting. \n\nFor the purpose of this market's resolution, determination as to whether a detonation was nuclear will be made by a preponderance of credible reporting.",

    "question": "Will SpaceX's Starship successfully reach outer space by March 31, 2023?",
    "description": "This is a market on whether SpaceX will successfully complete a launch of the next Starship intended to reach outer space, currently dubbed \"SN20\", by March 31, 2023.\n\nA successful launch will mean that Starship takes off from its launchpad and successfully reaches an altitude of 62 miles above sea level. The outcome will be corroborated by examining SpaceX\u2019s official video feed of the launch (https://www.youtube.com/c/SpaceX), as well as secondary video feeds or written reports if necessary.\n\nIf the Starship completes a successful launch by March 31 2023, 11:59 PM ET, this market will resolve to \u201cYes\u201d. Otherwise, this market will resolve to \u201cNo\u201d.\n\nAny subsequent anomaly (e.g. an explosion) after the vehicle reaches 62 miles will have no bearing on the outcome. Any name change of the Starship or replacement of \"SN20\" with another vehicle (i.e. \"SN21\", etc.) will have no bearing on the outcome of the market. Any SpaceX Starship launch that is not intended for outer space will have no bearing on the market. This market will resolve solely on whether the first Starship launch intended to reach outer space will successfully reach 62 miles above sea level by March 31, 2023.",
